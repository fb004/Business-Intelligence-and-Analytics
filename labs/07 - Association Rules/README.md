# ASSOCIATION RULES

This week, we explore association rule mining using the `mlxtend` library. This technique helps uncover patterns in transactional data, such as products often bought together. You'll learn to compute and use key metrics: support, confidence, and lift, and how to extract and filter meaningful rules.

After the [walkthrough](Walkthrough/walkthrough_association.ipynb), complete the [exercises](Exercises/exercise.ipynb) and the [quiz](https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1892740) for this lab.
